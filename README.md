# Python Project - 14 Captcha Solver
In this video, I demonstrate how to build a simple CAPTCHA solver using Python, Tesseract OCR, and the Pillow library. This project will help you understand basic image processing and text extraction from images.

In this tutorial, we will:
- Set up the Tesseract OCR executable for Python.
  ```python
  pip install pytesseract
  ```
- Open and process CAPTCHA images using the Pillow library.
  ```python
  pip install Pillow
  ```
- Extract text from CAPTCHA images using `pytesseract`.
- Discuss potential image preprocessing techniques to improve accuracy.
